Documents for the reformed oriented website rfrmd.com. To download the documents, click on the icon immediately to the left of the pencil icon that when hovered over reads "Download raw file" on the page displaying the document. I intend to try and provide additional formats for reading plans as well as other free printable resources. These docs are intended to be distributed without change unless discussed.
